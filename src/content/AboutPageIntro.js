        <p>
          Hi, I am Sam, I have a love of design and I have tried a lot
          of different art skills accumulating to this point in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a computer centric designer who has plentiful experience
          in most fields of design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have had the opportunity to start my career in London
          working in fashion design, migrating to interior design, and
          discovering CAD. From here I have developed my computer aided
          design skills in SketchUp Pro, Revit, and AutoCAD.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have built on my career in interiors and property by taking
          a postgraduate certificate in Building Information Management
          along side interior design for private clients, show homes and
          now commercial and retail for a larger company.

          I know the Adobe Create Suite inside out, Using photoshop,
          InDesign and Illustrator daily. I have 5 yearsâ€™ experience
          with daily use of SketchUp pro and I am now developing my
          skills with Revit and AutoCAD.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love using the computer software available to enhance
          design, and work out problem solving, bringing in my
          mathematical background.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am design focused even in my spare time I am either doing
          pottery and sculpting figures or drawing graphics for games
          and fashion on my iPad.

          technology skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create
          design heavy websites and progress my skills and interests
          with the changing market.
