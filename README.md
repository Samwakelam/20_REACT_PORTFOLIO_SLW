# Employee Directory - React 

This is a remodel of my portfolio built entirely in react with various npm packages included to maintain similar functionality to my week 8 portfolio. 

I have redesigned the full look of the website and created some different navigational elements. it is a demonstration of how much I have learnt in 20 intense weeks of Full stack web coding bootcamp.  

It is not yet mobile responsive but I aim for it to be in the short term.

## Improvements

Additions to be added: 
* Cv online and download copy for employers.
* Project 3 on completion of the course.
* Brand statment needs readdressing on the front page. 

I would like to add: 
* Mobile Responsiveness.
* There is plenty of white space in areas, this needs content adding or feature readjustment where appropriate. 
* The deployment has known routing issues through github pages and so the refresh ability results in a 404, this needs addressing when I have more time.

I have considered that it might be benificial to store some of my information skills and design data in a database that can then be called and mapped into components for better use of the react application.
